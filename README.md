# Embedded-Challenge: Wearable Speedometer

A team project from GY-8483: Real Time Embedded Systems. The goal is to build a wearable speedometer that can calculate velocities without a GPS. This is done through using the built-in gyroscope to measure angular velocities.

## Required Parts
1. STM32F429 Discovery Board with built in gyroscope
2. USB Power Bank
3. A way to store 20 seconds of velocity data, sampled at 0.5 second intervals
